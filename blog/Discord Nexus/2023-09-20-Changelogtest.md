# Hello Community!
Hey there! Thanks for visiting us. We're currently in the building stage and have a lot of ongoing work. I'm JumanJi, a community manager and developer with over 3 years of experience. One thing I've noticed is the lack of a comprehensive Discord guide and centralized resources. That's why we're working on the Discord Nexus project. It's been in the works for quite some time, but now, with the support of amazing developers and community moderators, we're bringing it to life. Special thanks to Robskan for their contribution to this project, making it possible to get our official logo commissioned by Nick. We also want to express our gratitude to the developers and designers who have contributed their skills and ideas to this project. It's important to note that we are a group of experienced developers and community managers working on this project without any profit motive. If you value our work and would like to support us, please consider contributing to the project and joining our Discord community. Together, we can discuss and improve the project.

# What is Discord Nexus all about?

It's a community-driven project by experienced independent developers, aiming to provide easy access to Discord's largest database without any premium or paywall restrictions. We're here to help you create your dream community on Discord.

# What this project will offer?
We've got exciting plans in store for you, including:
- Comprehensive Discord guides
- Official Discord resources
- Unofficial Discord resources
- Community-driven Discord resources
- A range of Discord tools for designing, moderation, AI, and development
- Free tools for your convenience
- The best bots available
- Informative blogs with official guides
- And a vast database to fulfill all your needs

With your support and community involvement, we can make all of this possible! #CommunityPower
