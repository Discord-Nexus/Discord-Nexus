# Hello Community!
Hey there! Thanks for visiting us. We're currently in the building stage and have a lot of ongoing work. I'm JumanJi, a community manager and developer with over 3 years of experience. One thing I've noticed is the lack of a comprehensive Discord guide and centralized resources. That's why we're working on the Discord Nexus project. It's been in the works for quite some time, but now, with the support of amazing developers and community moderators, we're bringing it to life. Special thanks to Robskan for their contribution to this project, making it possible to get our official logo commissioned by Nick. We also want to express our gratitude to the developers and designers who have contributed their skills and ideas to this project. It's important to note that we are a group of experienced developers and community managers working on this project without any profit motive. If you value our work and would like to support us, please consider contributing to the project and joining our Discord community. Together, we can discuss and improve the project.
