# What is Email Aliases?

Email aliases serve as a multifaceted tool in the contemporary digital landscape, offering a plethora of advantages that encompass privacy, communication organization, personal branding, and heightened security. In an era where online communication is ubiquitous, privacy and security concerns loom large. Email aliases address these concerns by providing users with an additional layer of defense, allowing them to share a customized email address without revealing their primary one. This not only safeguards against spam and phishing attacks but also shields against potential data breaches. Moreover, aliases streamline communication by enabling users to segregate incoming messages effectively; each alias can be associated with a specific purpose, such as work, personal contacts, or online subscriptions. This reduces inbox clutter and ensures that important messages aren't lost in a sea of less crucial emails. In a professional context, email aliases can serve as a potent tool for personal branding and enhancing one's professional image. Creating a custom alias that incorporates your domain name or relevant keywords can leave a lasting impression on clients and partners, exuding an air of credibility and commitment to your online presence. They also simplify filtering and sorting of messages through the application of rules that automatically categorize emails based on the alias used, ultimately saving time and improving the overall organization of communications.

## Recommendation:
You can use any other email aliases but we recomend to use [Simple Login](https://simplelogin.io/)! which is an open source yet own by a very reputed company Proton for their own service like providing encrypted email and other services to the users to protect their privacy.

## Use ProtonMail!!
Enhance your email security by utilizing ["ProtonMail"](htts://www.protonmail.com) with ["Simple Login"](https://simplelogin.io/). By incorporating ProtonMail, you can seamlessly manage both received and sent emails within the platform, minimizing reliance on your personal Gmail for updates. Personally, I opt for ProtonMail for its straightforward login, effectively organizing miscellaneous emails, while reserving Gmail for personal correspondence and essential notifications.

### Why Aliases instead of Gmail?
So before we start why we should use or concern about using Simple Login aliases instead of our regular email or gmail?

Using Simple Login Aliases and Proton Mail service for discord makes a great layer of protection for your privacy and helps you to stay anonymous in the platform. So if you you alot of service like free bot hosting or you may gave ramdom permission to a random bot which requires to access to your email, in that case the owner of the application or site have a log of your email address which is pretty annoying and not secure to spread your personal email in public. Mostly untrusted services may leak or sell your email address for money and can get you alot of spam mails, unrecognised ads etc may be faced in that situation. In that cause if you use the same email or gmail for bank or other personal documents or platform hackers can easily make you fool leak ips and more. But using the proton mail and aliases its totally encrypted and anonymous that you can easily block them. And using this both services you will not get any tracking from any service.
